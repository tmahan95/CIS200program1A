* Note, this is named Prog 0 as it was built on program 0.

Purpose: This program explores the creation of a simple class hierarchy including (limited) use of polymorphism.

In this assignment you will build on your instructor's solution to Program 0 (find under Course Documents). Adding to the Parcel hierarchy is first. Derived from Parcel are two classes, Letter and Package. The Letter class was already built in Program 0. The Package class will remain abstract but will track the dimensions (length, width, and height) in inches and weight in pounds of each package. Derived from Package are two classes, GroundPackage and AirPackage. Ground packages will calculate cost based on the package dimensions and weight and the distance between the origin and destination addresses (the Zone Distance), as described below. The AirPackage class will remain abstract but will add methods to determine if the package is large or heavy. Finally, derived from AirPackage are two classes, NextDayAirPackage and TwoDayAirPackage, both of which are concrete. Next-day air packages are charged an extra Express Fee. Two-day air packages may be delivered in the morning or the afternoon. If morning delivery is requested the package is an Early. If afternoon delivery is requested, the package is a Saver and a discount will apply. The detailed public specifications for the classes in this assignment appear below. Follow the naming, return types,and parameter lists specified below carefully. You may include private/protected helper methods/properties but no additional public methods or properties may be added without agreement from your instructor.

The detailed public requirements for the classes in this assignment appear below.

Package (abstract) - derived from Parcel

Constructor that specifies the origin address, destination address, length in inches (positive double), width in inches (positive double), height in inches (positive double), and the weight in pounds (positive double).
Get and set property for each of the data fields (Length, Width, Height, and Weight).
ToString method that will return all the data fields as a formatted String. All costs and fees should be formatted to display using currency formatting.
GroundPackage - derived from Package

Constructor that specifies the origin address, destination address, length in inches (positive double), width in inches (positive double), height in inches (positive double), and the weight in pounds (positive double).
int property ZoneDistance with a get (but no set). The zone distance is the positive difference between the first digit of the origin zip code and the first digit of the destination zip code. For example, the zone distance between zip codes 50000 and 10000 is 4 (5-1).
Override method CalcCost to calculate the shipping cost as
Cost (in dollars) = .20*(Length + Width + Height) + .05*(ZoneDist + 1)*(Weight)
ToString method that will return the all the values of the data fields (and zone distance) as a formatted
String. All costs and fees should be formatted to display using currency formatting.
AirPackage (abstract) - derived from Package
Constructor that specifies the origin address, destination address, length in inches (positive double), width in inches (positive double), height in inches (positive double), and the weight in pounds (positive double).
Method IsHeavy accepts no parameters and returns a boolean. An air package is considered heavy if it weighs 75 pounds or more.
Method IsLarge accepts no parameters and returns a boolean. An air package is considered large if the total of its dimensions (Length + Width + Height) is 100 inches or more.
ToString method as needed to return the all the values of the data fields (and heavy/large status) as a formatted String. All costs and fees should be formatted to display using currency formatting.
NextDayAirPackage - derived from AirPackage
Constructor that specifies the origin address, destination address, length in inches (positive double), width in inches (positive double), height in inches (positive double), and the weight in pounds (positive double), and the express fee (non-negative decimal), in dollars. The express fee may vary from store to store due to local competition, so it will be specified in the constructor.
Get property (no set) for ExpressFee.
Override method CalcCost to calculate the shipping cost as follows.
Base Cost (in dollars) = .40*(Length + Width + Height) + .30*(Weight) + ExpressFee
If the package is heavy, add a weight charge of
Weight Charge (in dollars) = .25*(Weight)
If the package is large, add a size charge of
Size Charge (in dollars) = .25*(Length + Width + Height)
ToString method as needed to return the all the values of the data fields as a formatted String. All costs and fees should be formatted to display using currency formatting.
TwoDayAirPackage - derived from AirPackage
Define Delivery enum with values Early and Saver.
Constructor that specifies the origin address, destination address, length in inches (positive double), width in inches (positive double), height in inches (positive double), and the weight in pounds (positive double), and delivery type (a Delivery enum value, for Early or Saver).
Get and set property for DeliveryType (using the Delivery enum).
Override method CalcCost to calculate the shipping cost as follows.
Base Cost (in dollars) = .25*(Length + Width + Height) + .25*(Weight)
If the package is Saver delivery type, the final cost will be reduced by 10%.
ToString method as needed to return the all the values of the data fields as a formatted String. All costs and fees should be formatted to display using currency formatting.
Please note the following restrictions to be enforced throughout your classes. Any attempt to set a property to or provide a constructor with an illegal value should throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

This part of the assignment will only focus on the hierarchy. While you will need to write a test program of some sort to verify that your classes work, it will not be graded. Only the Parcel hierarchy classes will be evaluated.
